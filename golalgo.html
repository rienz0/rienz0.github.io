These values correspond to <i>dead</i>, <i>alive</i>, <i>just born</i>, and <i>just died</i> states, respectively. For each cell within the matrix, the number of its neighbors is determined, and its value is updated according to the prescribed rules:</p><ul><li>If the cell is alive and its neighborhood is either less than 2 or exceeds 3, assign it the value corresponding to the <i>just died</i> state.</li><li>Conversely, if the cell is dead and its neighborhood count equals 3, assign it the value corresponding to the <i>just born</i> state.</li><li>In cases where the cell neither dies nor is born, its state remains unchanged.</li></ul><p>Furthermore, during neighborhood calculation, both currently alive cells and those <i>just died</i> are considered alive.</p><p>Lastly, a concluding pass is requisite, which may be executed seamlessly as an independent step. This involves substituting <i>just died</i> cells with dead cells and <i>just born</i> cells with alive cells, as these states merely signify promises regarding their subsequent status.</p><h2>Motivation</h2><p>The initiation of my search for such a method stemmed from the desire to emulate the Game of Life on my Numworks calculator, integrating user-adjustable cell dimensions. However, I faced a practical challenge â€” the calculator's 320x222 screen lacked the memory capacity to store even a small portion of the desired cell count. Hence, I began shaping an approach that obviated the need for memory allocation.</p><p>You can find an implementation of this method <a href="https://my.numworks.com/python/lokasku/conway">here</a>.</p></div></body></html>
