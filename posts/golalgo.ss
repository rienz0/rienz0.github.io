        "The initiation of my search for such a method stemmed from the desire to emulate the Game of Life on my Numworks calculator, integrating user-adjustable cell dimensions. However, I faced a practical challenge â€” the calculator's 320x222 screen lacked the memory capacity to store even a small portion of the desired cell count. Hence, I began shaping an approach that obviated the need for memory allocation.")
